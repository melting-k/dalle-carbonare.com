                            <h1>Restoration</h1>
                            <p>
								It’s the speciality of the workshop. After an expertise of the instrument, we work on quotation, respecting the rules of ethical and professional restoration.<br/>
                                Eight years of studies with the masters of violinmaking Michael Baumgartner and Jean Jacques Fasnacht (one of the best in Europe), and over 30 years of experience in this field, have allowed me to aquiere a precious knowlegge, that I share with my assistants.<br/>
                                We use over 300 years old spruce wood, that garanties the liability of the restoration in time, as well as the quality of sound.<br/> Regarding the varnish, we use the same products and methods as used by violinmakers in their time : cooked linseed oil, madder, olibanum resins, cooked amber…<br/>
                                Do not hesitate to come to the workshop to present us with your instruments, it will be an pleasure to inform you.
                            </p>

                            <h1>making</h1>
                            <p>
								I exclusively work on request, collaborating with the musician to conceive an instrument tailor-made and at his image. Together we choose the model and style of the oil varnish (new or antique). We also select the pieces of wood (maple and spruce) which I chose myself on standing trees in the forest, had cut down during the old winter moon between 1984 and 1992, and wich have been drying since in my workshop.<br/>
                                I equally suggest, for the spruce, some over 300 year old wood, to be used for the front, bassbar, and blocks.<br/>
                                The making of an instrument is a work that requires precision, patience, and thoughness. A constant apprenticeship for more than 35 years in quest of perfection.

								The workshop offers a deposit sale for your instruments and bows. We are rather more interested in old instruments. An 8% to 14% commission (depending on the value of the instrument) that includes the sound adjustements and insurance of the instrument, will be deduced from the sell price.

                            <p>
								The sound adjustments of an instrument are made with the musician exclusively on appointment. After complete verifying of the instrument (seams, fingerboard checking, string passing at the top nut, tailpiece length, …) A soundpost adjustment, other choice of string, or keeping of the instrument If needed for a bigger intervention (such as a new bridge, correcting of the neck angle or fingerboard, etc.) is suggested to the musician. <br/>
                                A well adjusted instrument makes the playing easy, optimises the sound, gives more pleasure.
